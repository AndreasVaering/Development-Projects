# Prototype v. 2.1 Description
The v. 2.1 prototype was developed by Andreas VÃ¦ring as a proof-of-concept product, that demonstrated that is possible to reliably record MIDI signal from the Keybird piano. This subbranch contains the design considerations and documentation of the v. 2.1 prototype.

The desired functionalites of the final product from Keybird is as follows.

| Functionality        | MoSCoW Prioritization           | Progress  |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-----:|
| MIDI recording     | Must have  | Done |
| Program change      | Must have      |   Done |
| USB-MIDI | Must have     |    Done |
| USB-5pin | Must have     |    Done |
| External PSU | Must have     |    Done |
| USB PSU | Should have     |    N/A |
| Foot pedal sensor | Must have     |    N/A |
| MIDI playback | Should have     |    N/A |

Not all functionalities have been implemented yet, but will either be done retroactive with this version of the prototype or the next iteration.
